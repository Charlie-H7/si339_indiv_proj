                    As a native spanish speaker I can assure you this call is terrifying.

                    Crazy how he apologises for foul language but his crew has no problems dissecting people whilst they're still alive. This man is all business.

                    He was so polite and apologetic at the end, and as a native spanish speakerâ€¦ he really meant it.

                    As someone whoâ€™s worked in numerous call centers I have to say heâ€™s still more respectful than most Karens.
